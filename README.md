# MLIR-based convolution and GEMM kernel generator for ROCm


This is the repository for a MLIR-based convolution and GEMM kernel generator
targetting AMD hardware. This generator is mainly used from
[MIOpen](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/)
and [MIGraphX](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/AMDMIGraphX),
but it can be used on a standalone basis. (The ability to use this code via
`torch-mlir` is being investigated as well.)

## Building (and testing)
To build the system

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
ninja check-rocmlir
```

By default, xdlops tests are enabled on MI-100, MI-200, and any other system
that supports mfma instructions.
xdlops tests are disabled on GPUs that do not support mfma instructions.
To disable xdlops tests on GPUs that supports mfma instructions,
add `-DROCMLIR_GEN_FLAGS="-mfma=off"` to the `cmake` invocation above.

To not actually run the tests, use `check-rocmlir-build-only`.

To build the static library that is used by MIOpen
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. -DBUILD_FAT_LIBROCKCOMPILER -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja librockCompiler
```


and to install it so MIOpen can find it
```
cmake --install . --component librockCompiler --prefix [your MIOpen deps]
```

## Standalone usage

For usage examples, see `mlir/test/rocmlir-driver`, especiallly the files
`sanity.mlir` and the contents of the `e2e_for_pr` directory.

This project also includes cod that translates from TOSA to kernels, see
`mlir/test/fusion` for examples of how to invoke it.

In general (with all invocations given from the build directory)
- `./bin/rocmlir-gen` generates high-level convolution operations and
  host code. Many of the options control data layout, size, etc, but some other
  useful flags are:
    - `-mfma=on` (which enables mfma usage)
    - `-mfma=off` (which disables mfma usage)
    - `-ph` (which causes host code to be generated)
    - `-pv` (which makes the host code validtae the results against a reference)
    - `-pv_with_gpu` (which uses a GPU validator instead)
    - `-pr` (which prints kkrnel results)
- `./bin/rocmlir-driver` is a wrapper around the kernel generation pipeline.
  Use `-c` (or `--kernel-pipeline=full --host-pipeline=runner`) to run the
  default pipeline


The result of the above pipeline can be passed to
`./external/llvm-project/llvm/bin/mlir-cpu-runner` .

`mlir-cpu-runner` needs to link the generated host code against libraries that
map from MLIR operations to the HIP runtime.
The required command-line arguments (if running from `build/`) are

```sh
./external/llvm-project/llvm/bin/mlir-cpu-runner --shared-libs=./external/llvm-project/llvm/lib/libmlir_rocm_runtime.so,./lib/libconv-validation-wrappers.so,./external/llvm-project/llvm/lib/libmlir_runner_utils.so --entry-point-result=void
```

Adding `--debug-only=serialize-to-blob` to the `rocmlir-driver` invocation
will cause the GCN assembly code for the kernels being executed to be dumped to
standard error.
